# Gibooru
**A PyPi package for asynchronously accessing image board APIs**

## Overview
This was a test project based around learning Python concurrency. The impetus was to determine how to aggregate image data sets for machine learning like the [Danbooru2021](https://www.gwern.net/Danbooru2021#danbooru2020) set. The package should work as intended, but some minor functionality may be deprecated due to the site APIs themselves being changed.
